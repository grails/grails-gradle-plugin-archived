# Grails Gradle Plugin

This plugin for Gradle allows you to build Grails projects. To use it, simply include the required JARs via `buildscript {}` and 'apply' the plugin:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "org.grails:grails-gradle-plugin:2.1.0"
  }
}

version "0.1"
group "example"

apply plugin: "grails"

repositories {
  grails.central() //creates a maven repo for the Grails Central repository (Core libraries and plugins)
}

grails {
  grailsVersion = '2.4.3'
  groovyVersion = '2.3.6'
  springLoadedVersion '1.1.5'
}

dependencies {
  bootstrap "org.grails.plugins:tomcat:7.0.50" // No container is deployed by default, so add this
  compile 'org.grails.plugins:resources:1.2' // Just an example of adding a Grails plugin
}
```
You must specify the `grails.grailsVersion` property before executing any Grails commands.

The 'grails.groovyVersion' property is a convenience for Grails 2.3.0, it may not work correctly in earlier
versions, so it's best to not use it with version pre-2.3.0. Declaring `grails.groovyVersion` will configure a Gradle ResolutionStrategy to modify all requests for `groovy-all` to be
for the version specified. Additionally, the ResolutionStrategy will change all requests for `groovy` to be `groovy-all`

The grails-gradle-plugin will populate the bootstrap, compile, and test classpaths with a base set of dependencies for Grails.
You need to provide a container plugin such as 'tomcat' to the bootstrap classpath to enable the run-app command.

*Warning* If you're using a pre-1.3.5 or pre-1.2.4 version of Grails, you'll need to add this runtime dependency to your project's build file:
```groovy
runtime org.aspectj:aspectjrt:1.6.8
```

Once you have this build file, you can create a Grails application with the 'init' task:
```sh
gradle init
```

Initialize a new Grails plugin project by running:
```sh
gradle init-plugin
```

The plugin creates standard tasks that mimic the Java lifecycle:

* clean
* test
* check
* build
* assemble

These tasks are wrapper tasks that declare a `dependsOn` to Grails specific tasks. This will allow for further build customization.

* clean [grails-clean]
* test [grails-test]
* assemble [grails-war or grails-package-plugin]

You can also access any Grails command by prefixing it with `grails-`. For example, to run the application:
```sh
gradle grails-run-app
```
If you want to pass in some arguments, you can do so via the `grailsArgs` project property:
```sh
gradle -PgrailsArgs='--inplace solr' grails-create-plugin
```
You can also change the environment via the `env` project property:
```sh
gradle -PgrailsEnv=prod grails-run-app
```
You can execute multiple Grails commands in a single step, but bear in mind that if you are passing `grailsEnv` or `grailsArgs` then each of the
commands will execute with the same values.

## Troubleshooting

* `Caused by: org.apache.tools.ant.BuildException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/cli/Options`

  This happens if your project depends on the `groovy` JAR rather than `groovy-all`. Change your dependency to the latter and all will be well.

* Classloading issues, casting proxy instances to their corresponding interface

  This can be a sign of a corrupted Spring-Loaded cache directory.  The plugin has spring-loaded cache in `$HOME/.grails/.slcache` - try cleaning that directory
